            an Open Educational Resource (OER) repository where faculty around the

            it became clear that simply providing a delivery platform for course materials
            was not enough to increase access to educational materials for the majority
            of students. After observing the upward trend of student debt and the
            well-defined and staying nature of introductory college course materials,
            OpenStax used grant support to create a line of free, peer- reviewed textbooks

            it easy for faculty to adopt ready-made high quality resources, and then
            use them as is or adapt them to meet their course\u2019s needs. In 2014,

            goal is to provide and maintain a commons where individuals and communities
            worldwide can create and freely share knowledge. The\_<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative
            Commons</a><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Attribution
            license</a>\_that you and every author must agree to enables the content
            to be as reusable as possible. All the content is accessible to anyone
            without restriction and any author can use that content, share it with
            others, or create a derivative work that is customized and personalized
            for their context.</p><p>The license also reduces everyone's risk, because
            it clarifies what the legal uses of the materials are. Without a license,
            everyone is forced to assume that the full protection of copyright law
            applies to your work, even if you intend to share it, or wanted it to
            be in the public domain. The license makes clear to lawyers and to other
            readers that this is your intention.</p><h3>Why should I make my work
            available under a Creative Commons Attribution license, instead of publishing
            it with the full protection of copyright law?</h3><p>There are several
            reasons. You might like the idea of others building upon your work, or
            the notion of contributing to an intellectual commons. As the community
            grows, you and other authors will have the satisfaction of helping develop
            new ways to collaborate. Another reason is that you may want your writings
            to be copied and shared, so your ideas can spread around the world. A
            young author may want to encourage the unrestrained dissemination of his
            or her works to help build a reputation. An established author might post
            samples of his or her work to create an interest in works that are outside
            of our repository. The Creative Commons license can help you implement
            such strategies while you retain the ultimate control of your copyright.</p><h3>What
            is Creative Commons?</h3><p>Creative Commons is a non-profit corporation
            that promotes the creative licensing and re-using of intellectual works.
            To quote from their Web site: \u201CCreative Commons is a new system,
            built within current copyright law, that allows you to share your creations
            with others and use music, movies, images, and text online that's been
            marked with a Creative Commons license.\u201D</p><h3>Is the content copyrighted
            and who owns the copyright?</h3><p>All material is copyrighted and the
            author retains the copyright of his or her material. The material is also
            licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license. Under this license
            the author gives others the freedom to copy, distribute, and display the
            work, and to make derivative works, as long as they give the original
            author credit. A link to a description of the Creative Commons Attribution
            license appears at the bottom of every content page.</p><h3>How do authors
            license their work in the content commons?</h3><p>Before you can create
            a page or book, you must agree to the Creative Content Attribution license
            that applies to all the content.</p><h3>Can I distribute or use my material
            elsewhere?</h3><p>Yes. The Creative Commons license is \"non-exclusive\"--
            which means that you are free to distribute your material under a different
            license elsewhere, publish it for profit, or transform it without endangering
            the version in our repository.</p><h3>How do I control what changes are
            made to my pages?</h3><p>Only persons who have the maintainer role on
            your page have permission to modify and publish an updated version of
            your page. As the author of a page, you determine who has the maintainer
            role on your page. The Creative Commons Attribution license does allow
            another person to make an adaptation of any content published in our repository.
            An adaptation is a derived copy of a page that is modified and published
            as a new page under the new author's name. Your original page is not changed
            and the adaptation contains a statement of attribution to you and a link
            to your original page.</p><h3>But wait, I thought the license gave people
            the right to make their own adaptations of my work?</h3><p>True, another
            author can indeed make an adaptation of your work according to the license.
            However, if you determine that someone has created an adaptation that
            is incorrect, or contradictory with your own, or worse, is defamatory
            or otherwise offensive, the license gives you the legal right to ask that
            person to remove your name from the page -- but not to demand that he
            or she change it as you wish. One way to avoid creation of such adaptations
            is to invite these other authors into your workgroup and develop a dialog
            with them as collaborators or co-authors.</p><h3>What prevents some dishonest
            person from stealing my works and claiming it as theirs?</h3><p>Nothing
            except the copyright law. The Creative Commons license is based on existing
            copyright law and your works have the same legal protections and legal
            standing as a copyrighted work that is published outside of our repository.
            You may actually run less risk using our repository than simply putting
            your work on your own Web page, because the license is clearly visible
            and clearly explains the uses people may legally make of your work. Strictly
            speaking, fraud and plagiarism are not the subject of copyright law, but
            copyright law is a good first defense.</p><h3>Can people make money off
            of my work?</h3><p>It is possible, but to be effective at all the license
            we use must allow some \"commercial\" uses. Consider the situation in
            which a printing service, such as a local printing service, offers to
            print your work so that your students may have access to hard copies.
            Without a license that allows commercial use, the service could not charge
            a fee to recover their printing, binding, and handling costs.</p><h3>That's
            fine, but what if some huge publisher decides to publish my work?</h3><p>If
            a publisher wants to include your page in a book of collected materials,
            they have that right according to the license, but remember that they
            are required to list you as the author and copyright holder. Our experience
            also suggests that most reputable publishers would want to re-negotiate
            a new license with you in that case. Furthermore, if you seriously expect
            to receive royalties from what you write, our repository is probably not
            the right place for the work -- though it might be the right place to
            experiment with an early version, or an alternative version.</p><h3>Does
            the Creative Commons Attribution license affect fair use rights?</h3><p>No.
            The license includes the statement: \"Nothing in this license is intended
            to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first
            sale, or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
            under copyright law or other applicable laws.\" Fair use, the first sale
            doctrine, and other such limitations apply whether a copyright holder
            consents to them or not.</p><h3>What must I do if I want to include a
            portion of an author's work in the repository in a work I am creating
            outside of the repository?</h3><p>You must give attribution to the portion
            of the original author's work that you include outside of our repository.
            This attribution is as simple as clearly naming the original author and
            identifying the portion of his or her work you are using. In addition
            you must retain the copyright notice and provide the URI of the original
            work.</p><h3>What must I do if I want to include another author's page
            in a book that I am building?</h3><p>Simply add the page to your book.
            Our software automatically includes the name of the original author in
            your book, giving him or her the attribution that is required by the Creative
            Commons license.</p><h3>Can I include material in my pages that was originally
            published outside of the repository and copyrighted?</h3><p>This simple
            question raises some complex legal points. It can best be answered by
            the copyright holder or an intellectual property attorney. We can tell
            you that any content you put into our repository is licensed under the
            Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, which means anything you use
            directly in your content must to be legally publishable under that license.
            The University of Texas System has a\_<a href=\"http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/\">Copyright
            Crash Course</a>\_and a\_<a href=\"http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/copypol2.html\">Copyright
            Tutorial</a>\_that can provide you with general information about copyright
            and reuse of copyrighted material. If you do obtain permission to use
            copyrighted material in your pages, we recommend that you include a note
            with the material that indicates who holds the copyright on the material.</p><h3>Does
            \"fair use\" enable me to use copyrighted material in my pages?</h3><p>Maybe
            yes, maybe no. There are many factors to consider before you can claim
            \"fair use\" for your reuse of copyrighted material. This is another question
            that can best be answered by the copyright holder or an intellectual property
            attorney.</p><h3>What legal standing does the Creative Commons license
            have outside of the United States?</h3><p>The Creative Commons license
            was crafted to be enforceable in as many jurisdictions as possible. That
            said, Creative Commons cannot account for every last nuance in the world's
            various copyright laws, at their current level of resources. The Creative
            Commons license does contain \"severability\" clauses -- meaning that,
            if a certain provision is found to be unenforceable in a certain place,
            that provision and only that provision drops out of the license, leaving
            the rest of the agreement intact.</p></p>"}
